**Resum: **This paper defends a version of literary cognitivism according to which, despite the fact that readers may derive different kinds of knowledge from fiction, only one of these forms of knowledge is genuine: the transmission of “what it is like” to be in a specific situation. This thesis is defended in three steps. First, I argue for an enlargement of the concept of knowledge to non-propositional forms, showing the limitations of the traditional concept of knowledge as justified true belief has when it comes to literature, and the benefits of including the concept of experience as a form of contact with reality within knowledge. In a second step, I scrutinise the notion of “literary experience” as an imaginative acquaintance with reality that is aesthetically valuable. Finally, I explore five factors that must be taken into consideration in order to determine whether the literary experience of the reader belongs to the experiential horizon of the literary work. The central claim of this paper is that fiction is a guided experience.
